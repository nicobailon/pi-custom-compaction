# Changelog

## 0.2.5 — 2026-04-04

- Add configurable `summaryRetention` controls so custom compaction can keep a chosen raw token amount or context-window percentage before summarizing older history.
- Support `summaryRetention` profile overrides, surface retention info in `/compact-policy` and the status bar, and document global vs project config behavior more clearly.
- Harden fallback behavior and model-resolution diagnostics for invalid selectors, impossible retention budgets, and thrown auth-resolution failures.
- Expand tests for retention resolution, preparation rebuilding, fallback paths, and model-resolution error handling.

## 0.2.4 — 2026-04-04

- Add `summaryRetention` policy controls for raw context retention with two modes: `tokens` (direct `keepRecentTokens` override) and `percent` (computed from `min(session model window, summary model window)`).
- Support `summaryRetention` overrides inside profiles.
- Add runtime fallback behavior for invalid/impossible retention resolutions: emit warning and hand off to Pi default compaction for that compaction run.
- Rebuild compaction preparation in the extension when retention overrides are active so custom keep boundaries apply before summary generation.
- Surface retention info in `/compact-policy` output and status bar text (`keep 20%`, `keep 40000t`).
- Expand tests with retention parsing/merge coverage, retention resolution/rebuild unit tests, and `session_before_compact` fallback integration coverage.

## 0.2.3 — 2026-04-04

- Bump pi package devDependencies to `^0.65.0` (`@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`, `@mariozechner/pi-ai`, `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`, `@mariozechner/pi-tui`) for compatibility with current pi SDK/tooling.

## 0.2.2 — 2026-03-28

- **OAuth/headers auth fix** — model resolution now uses `getApiKeyAndHeaders` (the actual SDK API) and threads headers through the entire summarization chain. Fixes OAuth-authenticated providers.
- **Diagnostic failure reasons** — when model resolution fails, the warning notification now includes specific reasons per model (e.g., "model not found", auth errors) instead of just listing which models were tried.
- **Profile model overrides** — profiles can now override the `models` list per session model. Use a different summarization model when chatting with Opus vs Codex.
- **Profile template paths** — profiles can specify explicit `template` and `updateTemplate` paths, overriding convention-based discovery. Tilde-expanded.
- **Compaction spinner widget** — animated `Loader` spinner displays during extension-initiated compaction, matching pi's built-in appearance.
- **Post-compaction status fix** — status bar no longer shows `?` for 1-2 messages after compaction. Shows just the label until token counts are available again.
- **Watchdog widget cleanup** — if compaction hangs and the 2-minute watchdog fires, the spinner widget is now properly removed.
- **Test suite** — 64 tests across 6 files covering parse, merge, config, pure logic, model resolution, and template discovery. Run with `tsx --test test/*.test.ts`.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-03-23

- Bump devDependencies to `^0.62.0`

## 0.2.0 — 2026-03-22

Initial release.

Custom compaction for Pi — swap the model used for compaction summaries, define your own summary template structure, and optionally trigger compaction at a specific token count. Everything is driven by a JSON config file with no UI overlay.

Core features:

- **Custom compaction model** with ordered fallback chain (`models`). If one provider's credits run out, the next model takes over. Per-model `thinkingLevel` and `preservationInstruction` overrides.
- **Token-based trigger** (`trigger.maxTokens`). Omit to let Pi's built-in decide when to compact. Set a value to proactively compact at that token count.
- **Custom summary templates** via convention-based markdown files. Separate initial and update templates so the model knows what to extract vs how to merge. Profile-specific templates supported. Entirely optional — Pi's built-in format works without one.
- **Profiles** — named overrides for trigger and summary settings that activate based on the session model. Match on exact `provider/modelId`.
- **Global and project config** — `~/.pi/agent/compaction-policy.json` (global) and `<project>/.pi/compaction-policy.json` (project, takes priority).
- **Status bar** with configurable label (`ui.name`), showing token usage relative to the effective trigger point.
- **Commands**: `/compact-policy` (show effective config) and `/compact-now [focus]` (trigger immediately).
- **Builtin skip margin** prevents double-triggering when the extension's trigger is close to Pi's own compaction threshold.
